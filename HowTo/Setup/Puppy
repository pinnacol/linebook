= Puppy Linux (INCOMPLETE)

Build a Puppy Linux base box using the following:

  * http://puppylinux.org/main/How%20to%20download%20Puppy.htm
  - name: puppy
  - Linux/Linux 2.6
  - 256 MB memory
  - 8 GB dynamically resizing drive

Add the iso to the cd/dvd device under Settings > Storage. Now start the
server and accept defaults when prompted. Now setup network connections
however needed, using Connect from the desktop. Ex:

  (Connect > Internet by wired or wireless LAN > Simple Network Setup > eth0)

Then:

  (Devices > CD/DVD Devices > Remove disk from virtual drive)
  VBoxManage snapshot puppy take RAW
  VBoxManage controlvm puppy poweroff
  # wait to fully power off
  VBoxManage modifyvm puppy --natpf1 'puppy-ssh,tcp,,2221,,22'
  VBoxManage modifyvm puppy --natpf1 'puppy-http,tcp,,8881,,80'
  VBoxManage -q snapshot puppy restore RAW
  VBoxManage startvm puppy

Now there are some issues:

* puppy linux uses it's own package management system (not yum/apt-get)
* the package system is not instantly usable
* openssh is not present
* no user management stuff appears to be present (ie sshd will need )
* ergo... the remainder will not work

Transfer your ssh key to the vm. Help to generate ssh keys can be found on
{GitHub}[http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect]:

  scp -P 2221 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@localhost:id_rsa.pub

To cleanup the port forwarding (run later, if ever):

  VBoxManage modifyvm puppy --natpf1 delete 'puppy-ssh'
  VBoxManage modifyvm puppy --natpf1 delete 'puppy-http'
