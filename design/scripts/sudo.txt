# Always execute a script and not multiple commands because sudo
# in different versions will and will not pass a '-' to the shell
# such that these could be equivalent:
#
#   sudo -i -u linecook abc
#   bash - abc
#   bash abc
#
# Unfortunately the middle one will crap out on commands. Ex:
#
#   bash - env
#   /usr/bin/env: /usr/bin/env: cannot execute binary file
#

# new env
sudo -u linecook [script]

# current env (not all sudo support -E)
sudo -E -u linecook [script]

# login env
sudo -i -u linecook [script]

# Note that there are equivalent commands using su, which is handy
# since not all sudo support -E.  The downside is that while you can
# setup sudo to not require a password, su does... so you need to
# invoke it as root in a scripting world.

# new env
env - su linecook [script]

# current env
su linecook [script]
su -m linecook [script]

# login env
su -l linecook [script]
