= Debian

<em>Note these instructions are for building a dev box only. In particular
they allow the linecook user to sudo without a password, which may not be in
you best production interests.</em>

Build an Debian base box using the following:

  * http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
  - name: debian
  - Debian
  - 384 MB memory
  - 8 GB dynamically resizing drive

Add the iso to the cd/dvd device under Settings > Storage. Now start the
server and install (use default settings unless specified):

  - root password: linecook
  - user/password: linecook
  - select 'SSH server' and 'Standard system utilities' as software to install

When the server has rebooted and is ready at the login screen, remove the
install iso, take a snapshot and setup port forwarding.

  (Devices > CD/DVD Devices > Remove disk from virtual drive)
  VBoxManage snapshot debian take RAW
  VBoxManage controlvm debian poweroff
  # wait to fully power off
  VBoxManage modifyvm debian --natpf1 'debian-ssh,tcp,,2222,,22'
  VBoxManage -q snapshot debian restore RAW
  VBoxManage startvm debian

Transfer your ssh key to the vm. Help to generate ssh keys can be found on
{GitHub}[http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect]:

  scp -P 2222 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub linecook@localhost:id_rsa.pub

Login as root and setup su for the linecook user:

  vm: vi /etc/pam.d/su

  # uncomment:
  #
  #   # Uncomment this if you want wheel members to be able to
  #   # su without a password.
  #   auth       sufficient pam_wheel.so trust
  #

  vm: groupadd wheel
  vm: usermod -a -G wheel linecook

Setup SSH for the linecook user:

  vm: su -l linecook
  vm: mkdir .ssh
  vm: mv id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: chmod 0700 .ssh
  vm: chmod 0600 .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: exit

Remove the login banner and exit:

  vm: rm /etc/motd
  vm: exit

Now take the standard snapshots:

  VBoxManage snapshot debian take BASE
  VBoxManage snapshot debian take CURRENT
  VBoxManage controlvm debian poweroff

To cleanup the port forwarding (run later, if ever):

  VBoxManage modifyvm debian --natpf1 delete 'debian-ssh'
