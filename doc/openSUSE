= openSUSE

Build an openSUSE base box using the following:

  * http://software.opensuse.org/113/en
  - name: opensuse
  - openSUSE
  - 512 MB memory
  - 8 GB dynamically resizing drive

Add the iso to the cd/dvd device under Settings > Storage. Now start the
server and install (use default settings unless specified):

  - Desktop Selection: Other > Minimal Server Selection
  - user/password: linecook

When the server has rebooted and is ready at the login screen, remove the
install iso, take a snapshot and setup port forwarding.

  (Devices > CD/DVD Devices > Remove disk from virtual drive)
  VBoxManage snapshot opensuse take RAW
  VBoxManage controlvm opensuse poweroff
  # wait to fully power off
  VBoxManage modifyvm opensuse --natpf1 'opensuse-ssh,tcp,,2223,,22'
  VBoxManage modifyvm opensuse --natpf1 'opensuse-http,tcp,,8883,,80'
  VBoxManage -q snapshot opensuse restore RAW
  VBoxManage startvm opensuse

Login as root, start sshd, stop the firewall, and setup sudo:

  vm: /etc/init.d/sshd start
  vm: rcSuSEfirewall2 stop
  vm: visudo
  
  # insert:
  #
  #   # Members of the linecook group may sudo without a password
  #   %linecook ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
  #
  # then exit (write out changes as prompted)
  
  vm: groupadd linecook
  vm: usermod -A linecook linecook

Transfer your ssh key to the vm. Help to generate ssh keys can be found on
{GitHub}[http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect]:

  scp -P 2223 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub linecook@localhost:id_rsa.pub

Setup SSH for linecook and exit:

  vm: su -l linecook
  vm: mkdir .ssh
  vm: mv id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: chmod 0700 .ssh
  vm: chmod 0600 .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: exit
  vm: exit

Now take the standard snapshots:

  VBoxManage snapshot opensuse take BASE
  VBoxManage snapshot opensuse take CURRENT
  VBoxManage controlvm opensuse poweroff

To cleanup the port forwarding (run later, if ever):

  VBoxManage modifyvm opensuse --natpf1 delete 'opensuse-ssh'
  VBoxManage modifyvm opensuse --natpf1 delete 'opensuse-http'
